## Mission

This website exists to help educate the world about horses. There are so many kinds of horses and they are all just so magical. After you read these pages you will definitely want to get one for yourself!

## Build instructions

We test and publish this website using a few simple tools. Please set up these tools (takes about 3 minutes) to contribute seriously to our project:

1. Set up Ruby on your system
   * For macOS, open Terminal.app and paste in these commands
     * [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (click the link and paste that one command into Terminal.app)
     * `brew install ruby`
   * For Linux Mint, open Terminal and paste in these commands
     * `sudo apt-get install ruby-dev build-essential libxml2 libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`
2. `gem update --system`
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `export NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true`
3. `bundle install`

Now you are done setting up. Use this command to build the website.

```sh
bundle exec rake build
```

You can now access the website by pointing your browser to the `BUILD` folder or running a command like `cd BUILD; php -S localhost:8000`.

Also, you can check for common problems on our website automatically, just run this command.

```sh
bundle exec rake test
```

## Deploy instructions

Use this command to publish the website online to our server.

```sh
bundle exec rake publish
```

You can only run that command if you have authorized SSH keys on your computer.
